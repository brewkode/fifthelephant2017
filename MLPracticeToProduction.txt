Part 1 - data, data, data
- Problem -> Collect -> Metrics -> Solve
- Collect -> Collect -> Collect; 
  - Problem -> Solve
- Storage is cheap, data is NOT
- Numerous data sources
- Transfer learning - pre-trained weights
- Source of bias, Contextualization or Localization

Organizing datasets
- Unbalanced datasets - 99% are not fraudulent
- Resampling - undersampling, synthetic datasets

Preprocessing playbooks
- Tokenization / Stopwords
- Dictionary / Embed
- Encode / Attention

Images
- Resizing / Normalization / Whitening / Augmentation / Dimensionality

Part 2 - Model
- Problem solving by practice
- Learning by gradient descent
- cheat sheet - for picking the right estimator
- Simple heuristic (set of rules) -> Complex heuristic
- Start modelling when you move from Simple heuristic to Complex heuristic
- Simplify your first objective - interpretable - accuracy vs explainability
- Ensembles all the way down

Model calibration
- Underconfident vs over-confident
- Cautious Vs Decisive

Past performance
- Launch first / break things / iterate next
