- Semantics & Categorical Attributes

Challenges
- understanding the semantic attributes
- extracting image features
- expensive training process
- proper training dataset

Solution
- use description of the product to enhance performance of image matching

Solr
- store deep learning features as numeric list
- create buckets of similar images
- LSH / Kernel based LSH
- Self taught hashing

Model to learn the hash function itself

Why self taught hashing
- Semantic hashing - mapping semantically similar images to nearby addresses
- binarized laplacian eigenmap decomp
- ML model as a hash

- New request handler
- Creating buckets of relevant documents using:
 - text based attributes
 - title sim
 - image hash bounds
- re-rank of documents based on sim
- tight coupling data with algo

- deep features from the final layer
