- query language - sql || k,v || graph
- Processing dimension - Bulk / Incremental
- Do you need - ACID - 1.0 txs, staleness, ordering, durable? vs 
  - ACID 2.0 - Scaling, Associative, Commutative, Idempotent, Distributed; transaction support, relaxed ordering - CRDTs, atleast-once delivery, HA
- Wire Protocol - compatibility with existing wire protocols - like http / grpc / postgres wire protocol / memcached / jdbc
- Schema vs Schema(less)
- Do you need CQRS ?
- Pluggable persistence, secondary indices - Graph
- Other considerations
  - Performance benchmarks - Latency / Thru put / Concurrency
  - Operations & Maintenance - MySQL as backend datastore for FB TAO
  - Support
  - Hosted Service

Under the hood
- Database type 
  - relational (row based) vs columnar (column stored together)
  - Document / KV
- Data organization
  - B-Tree
  - LSM - Log structured merge - append only, high speed inserts, reduces write amplification
- replication
  - sync / async
- consensus
  - used in leader election
- Jepsen tests for the software of choice
- Data export / restore - RPO / RTO - for DR
  - tools full export
  - large scale data migration
- MTTR - Node failure / Minor outages
  - promoting hot-standby
- Cost
  - Disk-Mem ratio
  - Power consumption
  - Density storage
- Data block-cache / buffer-pool
  - reduce disk i/0
  - lower latency on repeated reads
  - probabilistic ds - blooms
